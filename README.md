# hello-world
my goals
Hey Githubpersons...
always been a fan of php, python, java, android and so on

already made some python programs to visualize some magnetic fields with unit vectors

also had a look at the structure of andorid programs and wrote some very simple php programs

so i'd love to look into these things in greater detail :)

I really appreciate every advice with what i should start...
